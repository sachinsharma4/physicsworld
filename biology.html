    <h2>
        biological magnification
    </h2>
    <p>
        hello friend's today i am telling some sad tradgies occur due to biological magnification .<br>
        <br>
        before we start let talk about what is  biological magnification?<br>
        <br>
'increasing concetration of a compound 
  as we move up in food chain '</p>
this shown by (pd,cd,Hg,DDT,sn,sb)
these are known as cumlative poison
there is metabolic pathway which metabolise these compound so,they are store in body of organism and someone eat  him the compound accumulates in body predetor concentration increase.
<br>
ok but how  these compound affect human body <br>
<br>
pd replace the calcium of bones causes
pd poisoning .calcium EDTA is used to treat the disease.
<br>
Hg stays as Hg2+ inhibit many enzyme reaction particularly with thiol group
cause brain damage deefnes finally death. inorganic compounds less toxic
alkyl compunds more toxic and aryl  compounds are most toxic.
<br>
<br>
cd accumulates in kidneys and may replace Zn in some enzymes causing malfunctioning body or death
<br>
<br>
now friends time has come
so there we go
<br>
in 1900s mercury salts are used in production of felt hats.The dust affect the cns( central nervous system) tremor
of muscle called 'hatter's shakes'.
<br>
<br>
in 1952 minamata bay (Japan) 52 died by eating contaminated(by Hg) fish.
mercury poisoning outbreak occur agin in 1960 and in 1965 by contaminated shellfish.

<br>
<br>
corn seed which were treated with
organomercurial compounds eaten as food in iraq 1956 and again in 1960
which lead to several deaths.
<br>
<br>
DDT used as a insecticides .but now it is baned due to similar effect
actually there a person who write a book' slient spring' because this American president of that took the decision of banning DDT .the name of person is Rachel Carson
<br>
